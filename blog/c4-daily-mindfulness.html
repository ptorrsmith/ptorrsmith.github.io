                                        stamina and strength, the author suggests both focused mindfulness and
                                        attention
                                        (meditation and the likes of walking mindfulness) should be complemented with
                                        open,
                                        curios, wandering, and “everything is ok, there are no distractions”
                                        mindfulness.
                                        This could be an intentional part or phase of a meditation or active attention
                                        (e.g. focus on the breath or a sound or an object and keep returning to that),
                                        or
                                        during times of open attention or mindfulness in activity where we allow our
                                        minds
                                        to wander and appreciate or observe, and not be in such a hurry to “let it go”,
                                        but
                                        just observe and non-judgemental (on others or ourselves).</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Gradual effort and Sudden Enlightenment
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Basically acknowledging that noticing and experiencing the changes we want in
                                        our life and our being do not happen overnight, and are the result of regular
                                        effort to make the change</li>
                                    <li>At first we may not see any benefits at all. But then one day, after our
                                        perseverance of practice, we see that change in ourselves. This may be in
                                        adopting any regular habit such as exercise, when we suddenly realise the 2KM
                                        swim I thought was not possible was all of a sudden done with ease. Or it could
                                        be with mindfulness and meditation, when we may not only find it easy, if not
                                        desirable, to take the time for some focused mindfulness (e.g. meditation), but
                                        also that mindfulness as become a natural part of many parts of our day.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>


                        <h3>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</a></h3>
                        <p>I chose to do the “informal” mindful conversation with a few people yesterday as opposed to
                            sitting someone down for this exercise. I will do that at some point soon, but I’m keen to
                            close this sprint and get into Sprint 5 today. <br>
                            I also practiced “Mindfulness in action” yesterday, both during walking, and during
                            watching the All Blacks play South Africa last night.</p>
                        <p> From my informal mindful listening and “conversations” yesterday (which were in a social
                            environment and with people I’d not met before), I enjoyed the fact that I was consciously
                            paying attention and listening and not getting caught up in what I was going to say next.
                            If I found myself thinking about that, I gently acknowledged it and let it go, and regained
                            my attention to what they were saying. <br>
                            It felt quite liberating explicitly not worrying about what I would say, and allowing the
                            other person the space and time to speak, and to (semi-actively) be listened to.
                            I did not explicitly say “this is what I heard you say” back to them, but instead nodded
                            and made small gestures and “yes” type acknowledgements as they spoke, and once they had
                            clearly finished, I used what they had said to ask further questions about them and what
                            they had talked about. This way I found it was easy to show I heard them, and get any
                            clarifications from them of things I may have not heard properly just through my
                            questioning. <br>
                            It’s probably not quite the mindful conversations as per the book, but it felt good and
                            appropriate for the situation. </p>
                        <p>
                            Whilst walking to the event yesterday evening, I consciously practiced mindfulness in
                            action by focusing on my breathing as I walked, from letting my mind experience flow from
                            focusing on my breath to wandering off, and to also just appreciating the beauty around me
                            (the waterfront, the sky, the sound of the birds, the people walking by). <br>
                            I also found myself intentionally “being present” at the rugby game, choosing to watch the
                            players and the game and the ball attentively and to appreciate the experience and the
                            crowd atmosphere. I ended up noticing a lot more actions and passes and mistakes and wow
                            moves of the various players than I think I would have normally done.
                        </p>


                        <h3>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>

                        <p>The 3 suggested techniques in Search Inside Yourself, chapter 3, to sustain my mindfulness
                            practice are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Have a buddy - like a gym buddy, to keep each other on track, especially for first few
                                months as habits build</li>
                            <li>do less than I can - aim to do only 5 mins meditation each day, when I know I can do
                                20. Everything beyond 5 mins is a bonus and a celebration
                            </li>
                            <li>Commit to taking one mindful breath a day - This is not much, and so is an easy
                                commitment to fulfill (and feel great about) but the author proposes that simply the
                                intention to be mindful is in itself a meditation.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>I will add another to this list: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Grab mindful anytime, anywhere, any experience, and let every second of that be ok
                                and enough. I used to only do TM (Transcendental Meditation) for 20 mins only first
                                thing in the morning, and never after eating. Now I’m allowing myself to grab 10 or
                                15 mins anytime of the day, and of course I’m consciously taking myself into a
                                mindful state at times throughout the day in whatever I’m doing.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Any other musings?</h3>
                        <p>I’m enjoying using the Muse mind sensing headband and app. <br>
                            Not so much that I think the “sensing” element is overly accurate or scientific (it could
                            be, or it could just be a gimmick, or more likely a bit of both). </p>
                        <p>
                            The main reason is that
                            the first 10 sessions of the
                            guided meditations (actually, just intro and end) have been introducing different aspects
                            and approaches to meditation. And those suggestions, such as acknowledging when the mind
                            has wandered, to let that be ok, and to be intentful in letting it go and returning to the
                            breath, are in line with and complementary to the lessons being dicsussed in Search Inside
                            Yourself.</p>
                        <p>
                            I also have found that for me, if there are things I need to do but avoid them, if there’s
                            a way to “gadget it up” to make it fun or enjoyable, then I’ll do that to help me get
                            going. I did this with getting myself a Dyson cordless vacuum cleaner for my birthday a few
                            years back, and now with the Muse headband and software, it is helping make this habit a
                            lot easier :-)

                        <h3>Learnings on good HTML structure</h3>
                        <h5>Lists within lists</h5>
                        <p>As I was bringing my content into the HTML structure, I found myself having lists within
                            lists, and then wondering how this is best done (remember, browsers are very forgiving of
                            not-so-well structured HTML). <br>
                            A list in HTML can be ordered (numbered, <code>&lt;ol></code>) or unordered (bullets, <code>&lt;ul></code>).
                            Both however behave the
                            same:
                        </p>

                        <pre><code>&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>item 1&lt;/li>
    &lt;li>item 2&lt;/li>
    &lt;li>etc&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></code></pre>
                        <p>I was wondering if I wanted to put a list inside a list, should I close the <code>&lt;/li></code>
                            tag then start a new <code>&lt;ul></code> </p>
                        <p>So after a quick search online, I found the "correct" HTML5 structure is to include the
                            sub-list after the "parent" <code>&lt;li></code> tag and text, but before the parent's
                            <code>&lt;/li></code> </p>
                        <pre><code>&lt;ul>
    &lt;li>item 1&lt;/li>
    &lt;li>item 2 with a sub-list
        &lt;ul>
            &lt;li>item 2a&lt;/li>
            &lt;li>item 2b&lt;/li>
            &lt;li>etc&lt;/li>
        &lt;/ul>
    &lt;/li>
    &lt;li>etc&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul></code></pre>
