    <h1>Week T-10 - orientation and start sprint - c1 Time and Habits</h1>
    <p>August 13, 2018</p>
    <!-- a bit about my experience and thoughts on the readings and videos -->
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        I took about two hours to get through the materials and videos from the
        <a href="https://github.com/dev-academy-programme/curriculum/blob/master/resources/nt-time-ARTICLE/README.md">Time and habit management resources</a>. I started with the videos to get me into the swing of things, then checked
        out the Fogg method, before working through the readings starting with meditation.
    </p>
    <h2>reflections on time and habit techniques</h2>

    <h3>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
    <p>I have been meditating on and off for many years already, and did meditate this morning. I also swim about 2-3 times
        a week, and find that very meditative (and satisfying in many other ways). These, along with yoga at Dev Academy,
        are habits I'd like to keep regular over the coming four months.</p>
    <p>I've also run a few sprint based projects, so have experienced using team sprint timeboxing. However I've not been very strong so far on timeboxing my own work and tasks.  I have however been taking breaks between and during the work assignments, and allowing those breaks to be non-study/work time</p>
    <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
    <p>The idea of small steps on a journey of growth is a common theme in many of the articles. This was seen in the
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKUJxjn-R8">Fogg Method talk</a>, where he points out small steps are easy to do, but they can build up our ability and our motivation
        over time.</p>

    <p>In the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">Wikipedia article on Flow</a>, I enjoyed discovering the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi">Flow model's</a> graph on mental state in terms of challenge level and skill level</p>

 -->
    </div>
    <p>I enjoyed the <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/make-it-big-by-starting-small">article on starting small</a>, and the dangers of big.</p>
    <p>But I think my favourite read was <a href="http://paidtoexist.com/counterintuitive-productivity/">Seven counterintuitive ways to be insanely productive</a> as it resonated with many of my own quirky ways.</p>  

    <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
    <p>Meditation. Swimming. Yoga. </p>
    <p>Small chunks, tasks, tick off via Waffle, and I guess that's what I did over the weekend, I grew my skill level in small chunks, overcoming challenges then having a break</p>
    <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
    <p>Timeboxing and Pomodoro style chunking of focused work, with breaks in between (perhaps 2 pushups followed by an "I'm awesome!")</p>
