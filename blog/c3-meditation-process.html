                        <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and
                            rebuild?</h3>
                        <p>It was good to be encouraged to allow each step in the design process to take some time. and
                            have their own learning and doing challenges. </p>

                        <p> I've enjoyed exploring and designing and deciding and prioritising the features and
                            elements for the first early version of this redesign and rebuild of the website</p>
                        <p> I have enjoyed outlining the needs and goals for the site, and
                            identifying the main page types and page elements that a site visitor would need to ineract
                            successfully
                            with the site.
                        </p>
                        <p>And then the learning of the <a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton Framework</a>, which
                            took a bit to grapple with, was a
                            journey in itself. But as I did, my basic CSS skills got a little bit better.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Needless to say, I've yet still to master many aspects of the structuring a site in HTML
                            and Styling it with <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and I think the
                            Skeleton framework was useful
                            for
                            going through the process of designing mobile first.
                        </p>


                        <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
                        <p>
                            I already have experienced some benefits of meditation in my life.
                            I new it must be good for my well-being and my mind. But I hadn't overly
                            analysed it as to what I was expecting it to do, or how else I could look at it.
                        </p>
                        <h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
                        <p>
                            I have mostly done Transcendental Meditation which uses a personal mantra for a 20-minute
                            meditation.
                            I have mostly meditated first thing in the morning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So using the focus on the breath, starting out with short meditations, and understanding a
                            bit more of the simplicity of it has been a nice re-learning.

                        </p>
                        <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Focusing on my breath, and allowing a short meditation anytime as been useful.
                        </p>
                        <p>I will try to focus a bit more on my back when sitting for meditation.</p>

                            <h5>How about some tech for your mental health?!<br>
                                Here's my thoughts on the Muse brain sensing head band</h5>
                            <p>I have been gifted a Muse brain sensing headband, and have been giving it a go as part
                                of my mindfulness meditation practice for a couple of days.
                            </p>
                            <p>The app plays nature sounds at varying levels of intensity based on what it is sensing
                                via the headband. The sounds range from heavy rain, down to mild rain, light and gentle
                                rain,
                                birds starting to chirp. The idea is to calm the mind and get the rain falling softly
                                or not at
                                all, and let the birds chirp.
