                        <h3>Chapter Overview - Developing Empathy through understanding and connecting with others</h3>
                        <h4>Empathy is hard-wired into us</h4>
                        <p>Our minds are wired for empathy it appers, as a nutural survival skill. The same parts of
                            brain are activated when doing/feeling things ourselves as when seeing/feeling others in
                            similar situations. Empathy builds trust and understanding, and is essential to getting
                            through the tough times</p>
                        <p>Empathy is no analysing, psycholigizing, or just agreeing</p>
                        <h4>Ways to Increase Empathy</h4>
                        <p>Create desired mental habits - when you meet or think of someone, have your first thought be
                            that they are just like me you want this person to be happy</p>
                        <p>The book introduces a thought and meditative practice called <strong>Just Like Me / Loving
                                Kindness</strong>. It's a simple practice of understanding they are a human with
                            feelings and emotions like me, that they wish to be happy and loved and have fulfulling
                            relationships, just like me. And then in our minds we wish this other person to have the
                            strength, resources and emotional and social support to navigate the difficulties of life,
                            and wish them to be free from pain and suffering and for them to be happy, because they are
                            a human, just like me.</p>
                        <h4>Brininging Out the Best in People - and Useful Praise</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Establish trust</li>
                            <li>Listen (Mindful Listening)</li>
                            <li>Ask, be curious</li>
                            <li>Feedback</li>
                            <li>Partner to create options and practices</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Watch out for traits of dysfunctional teams</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Absence of trust</li>
                            <li>Fear of conflict - not willing to challenge</li>
                            <li>Lack of committment</li>
                            <li>Avoidance of accountability</li>
                            <li>Inattention to results</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>So Building Trust is the foundation... and the biggest part</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Start with Kindness, Sincerity and Openness</li>
                            <li>Recognize other person is human, with emotions, goals, challenges - not just a
                                customer, or supplier or colleague or junior</li>
                            <li>Practice giving people the benefit of the doubt - their intentions were good at the
                                time</li>
                            <li>Trust begets trust, so assume they are trustworthy and share part of you</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Three Assumptions for constructive meetings and interactions</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>...everyone is here to serve the greater good, until proven othersie</li>
                            <li>...nobody has hidden agendas, until proven otherwise</li>
                            <li>...we are all reasonable even when we disagree, until proven otherwise</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>Empathetic Listening</h5>
                        <p>Like mindful listening where we listen, enquire, respond with our understanding, and observe
                            our own thoughts and feelings, however we listen and sense what they may be feeling. </p>
                        <p>Formally (in an exercise together) this may be responding with the likes of "What I hear you
                            feel is ...". In daily life however, it's much more subtle, in that we actively try to
                            understand what they are both saying, and feeling, and weave that understanding into the
                            conversation, given the other person the airtime to be heard and understood</p>
                        <p>In times where you feel you may have heard what they are feeling, and want to get a sense of
                            if your approach or understanding was of use, you may ask something like "was this
                            conversation helpful?"</p>
                        <h5>Skillful Praising</h5>
                        <p>Or what I see more as "useful praising", this is focusing on a persons behaviours and
                            effort, and not things which may be seen as inherent traiuts of the person.</p>
                        <p>So instead of saying, "You're a natural with the clients" or "You're so smart being able to
                            sort that gnarly bug out", you might instead comment "I like the way you made sure the
                            client felt understood with you diagrams", or "That was quite an effort you put it last
                            night on figuring out what had happened"</p>
                        <h4>Political Awareness is Empathy - across a diverse fabric of people and interactions</h4>
                        <p>This is understanding the feelings needs and concerns of individuals <strong>and</strong>
                            how their feelings, needs and concerns interact with those of others, <strong>and</strong>
                            how that weaves into the fabric of the organisation or group.
                        </p>
                        <h5>Increasing Political Awareness and Abilities</h5>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Rich personal networks and connections - allies, mentors, groups to support and
                                challenge me</li>
                            <li>Read the currents, understand how decisions made, processes and key deciders</li>
                            <li>Distinguish between own self-interests, those of the team, and the organisation, and
                                other stakeholder</li>
                            <li>Use self-awareness to understand my role in the web of personalities and interactions.
                                Use empathetic listening to understand
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h5>An exercise to understand</h5>
                        <p>Descibe a situation from the perspective of you were 100% right.</p>
                        <p>Then describe the same situation from the perspective of they other person was 100% right.</p>




                        <h3>Enspiral Dev Academy - Blog Questions</h3>
                        <h4>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How
                            did it go?</h4>
                        <p>I was taught many years ago one of the keys to building trust was to make small committments
                            and keep them. Though I'm sure I can do better, I've found this a useful guide.
                        </p>
                        <p>Adding kindness, sincerity, openness and recognizing the other human is just like me bring
                            extra tools to my approach to create great relationships.</p>

                        <h4>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h4>
                        <p>I do more Informal Empathetic listening. Feel I have been doing that for a while, sensing
                            what
                            feelings and perspectives and needs the other person or people May have</p>
                        <h4>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h4>
                        <p>It was a nice process to keep things centred, and to pre-load a relationship with good
                            foundations. I felt like it made subsequent interactions a lot more loving and I was more
                            open and accepting.
                        </p>
                        <h4>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h4>
                        <p>Thinking of a situation earlier this year with one of my colleagues at work.
                        </p>
                        <p>I thought it was unreasonable of her to start accusing me of not consulting with her when I
                            had agreed with her Team manager Several months before and had been operating the new way
                            for those months. I felt she had empowered her manager to decide such things and that she
                            had not discussed with her manager before attacking me.
                        </p>
                        <p>From her perspective, she has a lot of responsibility and was not aware of the change and
                            felt she should have been consulted</p>
