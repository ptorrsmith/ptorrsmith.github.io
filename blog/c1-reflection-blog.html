    <h2>Notes to incorporate</h2>
    <p>
        Real first weekend of study and practice.    </p>
    <p>
        My head hurts!  But now I'm getting familiar with the command-line, git, git branching, and github.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've pushed my first few commits up to github, and made my github.io website 
repository and published <a href="../index.html">a very basic home page</a> and this blog post.
    </p>

    <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2>
    <p>I was surprised to see how similar the conversation and expectations were, and that this fireside chat was 4 years ago.  I felt at ease after listening to the chat and the Q&amp;A session where many of my own questions were addressed.</p>
    <p></p>
    <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
    <p>blah</p>
    <h2>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
    <p>Throwing myself in boots and all</p>
    <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
    <p>I always expected it would be about culture and self-learning, and this has been shown to be the case with the balance of tech vs human-skills</p>
    <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
    <p>Yes, excited and nervous. But after this weekend, knowing that I took the time to learn, to go back to basics, and that I know things today that I didnâ€™t know on Friday, has given me a boost in enthusiasm and confidence in myself.</p>
