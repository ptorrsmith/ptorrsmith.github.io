    <h2>Welcome to my journey <em>Learning the ways</em> 2018 </h2>
    <h3>August 12, 2018</h3>
    <!-- a bit about my first week -->
    
    <p>
        Real first weekend of study and practice.    </p>
    <p>
        My head hurts!  But now I'm getting familiar with the command-line, git, git branching, and github.
    </p>
    <p>
        And I'v pushed my first few commits up to github, and made my github.io website repository and published it.
