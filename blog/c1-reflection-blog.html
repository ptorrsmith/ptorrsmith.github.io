    <h2>Notes to incorporate</h2>
    <p>
        Real first weekend of study and practice.    </p>
    <p>
        My head hurts!  But now I'm getting familiar with the command-line, git, git branching, and github.
    </p>
    <p>
        I've pushed my first few commits up to github, and made my github.io website 
repository and published <a href="../index.html">a very basic home page</a> and this blog post.
