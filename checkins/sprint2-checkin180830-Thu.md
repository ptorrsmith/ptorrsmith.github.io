Tēnā koutou katoa i tēnei ahiahi
Hello all of you this evening

Checking in after having yesterday off work and study with wisdom teeth surgery... lots of fun indeed!

Anyway...

<h1>How are you doing personally? </h1>
A bit physically bruised and beaten in my jaw. Was wiped out all of yesterday and a crazy night's sleep after sedatives and painkillers.  But recovering well I think, but eating has been a bit challenging today.
I'm feeling good about life in general and am enjoying my path mostly.  I finish work on Thursday, so I've got a number of things to finish off for MSD next week. After that It's full-time Dev Academy for the remaining 5 weeks before bootcamp!

I'm  about half-way through Sprint 2, so not speedy but definitely enjoying the learning and working.

<h1>How are you doing technically? </h1>
I'm still going slow but steady through the materials, lessons and practice.  Got through the Grid and Bootstrap lessons and loved that. Grid and Bootstrap certainly help out a lot!

I like how it allows us to assign lots of classes to an element but makes each class selector and declaration only responsible for a single task, such as UPPERCASING with .text-uppercase.  Good guidance for our own stylesheets I suspect.

The tutorials and lessons have helped link things together for me.  Working now to publish my Tech Blog part 1.


<h1>If you could live in any place in the world (air land sea and space!) where would it be? </h1>

I'm thinking Northland at Shipwreck bay on Te-Oneroa-a-Tōhē/Ninety Mile Beach. Good weather, fishing and surf.
Or perhaps Valencia or Barcelona, overlooking the mediterrean :slightly_smiling_face:
My Māori ancestry, where my grandmother grew-up, is from Wairoa.  I do like Mahia.

Love Wellington, but could enjoy some time in Queensland for the winter :slightly_smiling_face:
