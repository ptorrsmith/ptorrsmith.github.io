Morena follow Foundations Wellington team!

Just finishing Sprint 1, so a bit of a slow start for me.
My name is Peter Torr Smith (last name Smith)
Peter in Te Reo is Pita, which I like, but haven't used much. We'll see :slightly_smiling_face:
I'm based in our beautiful capital city, living in Aro Valley.  Nice it's only a few minutes walk to EDA :slightly_smiling_face:
I'm attending EDA as a bit of a reset for me.
I have been in various technical and management roles over the years, so am not unfamiliar with a lot of technologies and architectures
but I'm low on the details, and haven't done any coding for about 10 years
I'm wanting to go back into learning mode, to recharge and rewire the brain, to meet some energetic folk, and to understand some of the latest web stack approaches.
I co-founded a web business in 2007, www.hirethings.com, and did some of the early dev work, but was more involved in the business and operational side of things.
Things didn't work out as hoped, but Hire Things is still going, but needs lots of love

Anyway, here to learn, refresh, and give to you all what I can (edited)
and learn from you all
I read @Ranjit_E_Hihi's blog https://ranjit03.github.io/.  He reiterated to me the value in learning new things, and the power of habits and small actions often.  I also learned a bit about the box model, but decided not to get too far ahead of myself.
I'm jworking full-time still until Thurs 6th Sept (last day at MSD).
I'm flexible to meet anyone who wants during that time, either early for a coffee/breakfast (7/7:30?) or after work about 5:30/6.

Happy to have folk come up to my place in Aro St (opposite Garage Project) to study/meet.

and I can make a good espresso or flat white :slightly_smiling_face:
Anyway, that was not a short post... and i'll finish this off.  I've just completed Sprint 1, and am now in the Gold Coast and Brisbane for a week with Natalie and visiting my Sister and kids here.  Trying to get much work on Sprint 2 over here seems a bit challenging, as I'm trying to be present with Natalie and my family for this... and I'll need their understanding and support over the coming months!
Aroha. Pita. :slightly_smiling_face:
