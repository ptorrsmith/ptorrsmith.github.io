Hi crew!  Hope everyone is getting well underway.  I'm nearly finished sprint 1, just gotta tell you a bit about myself... but I'm about to catch a plane to the GC for a week for a wedding and family visit, so I'll be trying to progress into Sprint 2 a bit whilst over there.   Ngā mihi.  Peter / Pita

@kelly_eda Kia ora a Kelly.  Please could you load up Sprint 2 for me?  I'll be finished sprint 1 by tomorrow.  Ngā mihi.
